[Print Appendix A](/print-appendix-a) contains bibliographic data on all 479 editions of printed
practical books analyzed in _Reading Practice_, as well as a discussion of the parameters used
to identify "practical books" within the _English Short Title Catalogue_. Data can be viewed 
in a spreadsheet or downloaded in CSV format.

[Print Appendix B](/print-appendix-b) contains a network analysis illustrating the relationship 
between London's printers and popular editions of practical books, created using the standardized 
and cleaned data from Print Appendix A and the open-access software Cytoscape.  

<br>
[Print Appendix C](/print-appendix-c) features several data visualizations created with the
software Tableau which illustrate the most popular genres, most common size, and most prolific printers
of practical books in England between 1485â€“1600.
