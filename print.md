#### About the Data 
In _Reading Practice_ I trace the circulation of natural knowledge in both fifteenth-century
manuscripts and over 475 editions early printed "practical" books published between 1485 and 1600. I defined a practical book as 
a book in the vernacular containing useful (and not strictly theoretical) knowledge related to
medicine and science. In practical terms, this definition includes the following genres: 

- medical recipe collections
- herbals
- astrological manuals
- agricultural treatises
- anatomies
- surgeries
- dietaries or health regimens
- urinaries
- books on distillation
- gardening manuals
- books on hawking and hunting
- husbandry manuals
- veterinary medicine 

I focused on these genres because these are the same categories of knowledge commonly found in fifteenth-century
vernacular manuscripts, and because they represent the sort of natural knowledge that I believe that all those who
_could_ read, _did_ read in sixteenth-century England. For these reasons, I chose not to include vernacular books 
on navigation, metallurgy, or weaponry in my corpus of "practical books." These categories of natural
knowledge are not well-represented in the fifteenth-century vernacular manuscripts I examined.

<br>
To arrive at this corpus of over 475 editions of English "practical books," I searched the digital _English Short Title Catalogue_ 
([http://estc.bl.uk](http://estc.bl.uk)), which contains bibliographical data drawn from Katherine Pantzer, et al, eds., _A Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland, and Ireland, 
and of English Books Printed Abroad, 1475–1640,_ 3 vols., Revised and enlarged second edition (London: Bibliographical Society, 1976–1993). 
I combed through publication data decade-by-decade, beginning with the introduction of the press in 1476 up to
the close of the sixteenth century to identify every edition of the genres listed above published in England over that time.
No doubt I have missed editions in my search; I will continue to update this spreadsheet and welcome feedback from users.

#### Access the Data
The data I collected from the _ESTC_ can be viewed in the spreadsheet (below). To download this data as a CSV file, click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRycTIz4A5N-61tgUAu5tG7bpIWBuVSmEqzudvayuhTsZtR9qrBA_K9_GkctWreIOgzIWuGJDE8IV4Y/pub?output=csv). 
The spreadsheet contains the following information as printed in the _English Short Title Catalogue._:
- Publication date
- STC number (revised)
- Standardized short title**
- Genre of practical knowledge
- Place of publication
- Printer
- Size of edition
- Author 
- Editor 
- Translator

**_Early modern printers saw no reason to use the same title in subsequent re-editions of the same texts. Because the
purpose of my research was to demonstrate how the same texts and genres of natural knowledge reappeared in multiple
editions of printed books--over and over again--I chose to standardize the titles of the same texts so that I could use 
this data for my network analysis. See [Print Appendix A]({{ site.baseurl }}/print-appendix-a) for more information about the
how I standardized these titles._

#### About the Print Appendices

With this data in hand, I was able to create both a network analysis [(Appendix A)]({{ site.baseurl }}/appendix-a) 
illustrating the relationship between London's printers and popular editions of practical books, 
as well as several data visualizations [(Appendix B)]({{ site.baseurl }}/appendix-b) that illustrate the most popular genres, most common size, and most prolific printers
of practical books between 1485–1600.
