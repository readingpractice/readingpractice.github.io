#### [Print Appendix A: Network Analysis of Printers and Editions of Practical Books]({{ site.baseurl }}/print-appendix-a/)
#### [Print Appendix B: Data Visualizations]({{ site.baseurl }}/print-appendix-b/)

In _Reading Practice_ I trace the circulation of natural knowledge in both fifteenth-century
manuscripts and early printed books. The data for these print appendices was The data was sourced
from Katherine Pantzer, et al, eds., _A Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and of English Books Printed Abroad, 1475–1640,_
3 vols., Revised and enlarged second edition (London: Bibliographical Society, 1976–1993), now 
accessible as an searchable online database, [http://estc.bl.uk](http://estc.bl.uk). I 
searched the digital _ESTCA_ to find all editions of medical recipes, herbals, astrological treatises, agricultural 
treatises, anatomies, surgeries, health regimens, urinaries, books on distillation, agricultural 
manuals, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine published between 1485 and 1600. I used 
Zotero's web-scraping tool to pull publication data from the online _ESTC_, and then exported 
my Zotero data into a CSV file so that I could clean and standardize the data using OpenRefine.

The data I collected and cleaned from the _ESTC_ can be viewed in the spreadsheet (below),
which gives the publication date, the printer, size, and genre of natural knowledge for 
every edition of a practical book printed between 1485 and 1600 and listed in the _English Short Title Catalogue._

With this data in hand, I was able to create both a network analysis [(Appendix A)]({{ site.baseurl }}/appendix-a) 
illustrating the relationship between London's printers and popular editions of practical books, 
as well as several data visualizations [(Appendix B)]({{ site.baseurl }}/appendix-b) that illustrate the most popular genres, most common size, and most prolific printers
of practical books between 1485–1600.
