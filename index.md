## Digital Appendices

This site will host the bibliographic data collected
for my book ___Reading Practice: The Pursuit of Natural Knowledge from Manuscript to Print,___ forthcoming from [The University of Chicago Press](https://press.uchicago.edu/index.html) in 
Summer 2024. Over the course of ten years in archives and libraries in the United Kingdom
and United States, I have viewed over 300 fifteenth-century vernacular, English medical and scientific
manuscripts, over 180 of which became the primary sources for my books. In addition to in-person
manuscript research, I have also combed through the online [_English Short Title Catalogue,_](http://estc.bl.uk/)
to trace how vernacular medicine and science moved from manuscript into print. I have compiled a database
of over 500 early printed almanacs, prognostications, medical recipe books, husbandry manuals,
herbals, urinaries, anatomies, dietaries, and books of secrets.
