_Reading Practice: The Pursuit of Natural Knowledge from Manuscript to Print_, forthcoming from 
[The University of Chicago Press](https://press.uchicago.edu/index.html) in Summer 2024. These appendices include
data on the formats, contents, and reader marks of 182 fifteenth-century English vernacular manuscripts, accessible on
visit the [Manuscript Appendices]({{ site.baseurl }}/manuscripts) page, as well as publication data
for over 475+ editions of early printed medical recipe collections, almanacs, prognostications, surgical treatises,
uroscopies, herbals, and books of secrets published between 1485 and 1600, accessible on the
[Print Appendices]({{ site.baseurl }}/print) page.

## About *Reading Practice*
_Reading Practice: The Pursuit of Natural Knowledge from Manuscript to Print_ tells the 
story of how ordinary English people grew comfortable acting as adjudicators of natural knowledge 
through interactions with hundreds of manuscripts and printed books: almanacs, medical recipe 
collections, herbals, and prognostications. These were the books English people read from around 
the turn of the fifteenth century to the close of the sixteenth century when they wanted to 
attend to their health, manage the unpredictability of illness, or understand their place in 
the divinely-created universe. Before 1375 or so, this corpus of natural knowledge had largely 
been confined to monks or university clerics who could read the Latin in which most medieval 
medicine and science was written. To be sure, ordinary people outside the church tended wounds 
and watched the stars just as often as did learned monks, but their knowledge (though we would 
call it experiential or observational) was afforded very little status within medieval culture.
Around the year 1400, however, manuscripts steadily got less expensive just as valued medical 
and scientific texts became available in Middle English. What resulted was a wholesale 
transformation in how the English laity accessed and experienced knowledge about the natural world.

<br>
Over the course of the fifteenth century, the English created hundreds of manuscripts filled 
with texts that guided them through the practices of healing, tending crops, making medicines, 
or forecasting the weather. These “practical manuscripts,” as I call them, invited English readers 
into a very old and learned conversation. In these books, Hippocrates and Galen weren’t distant 
authorities whose word was law; they were trusted guides, whose advice could be excerpted, 
rearranged, recombined, and even altered when it suited a manuscript compiler or printer’s needs. 
English readers grew confident assessing and critiquing this ancient knowledge in the margins 
of fifteenth-century manuscript remedy collections.After William Caxton introduced the printing 
press to England in 1476, English printers eagerly mined fifteenth-century manuscript collections 
for popular medical recipes or herbal remedies that they would publish, over and over again, 
throughout the sixteenth century. Whereas printers in France or Germany or Italy published more 
Latin books than vernacular ones in the early decades of print, the opposite was the case in England. 
English printers’ preference for the vernacular—to include vernacular medicine and science—kept 
England on the periphery of learned European medical culture, but at the same time, it put 
non-elite readers at the center of debates about the body, health, and the natural world 
within England. In the sixteenth-century bookshops around St. Paul’s Cathedral, English 
readers made choices about which of the dozens of almanacs, recipe books, herbals, or 
prognostications to purchase and read. Here, too, they were assessing and evaluating knowledge 
claims: some of them ancient, some of them newly invented by savvy publishers hoping to sell more books. 
<br>
<br>
_Reading Practice_ argues that English readers learned to be discerning and selective 
consumers of knowledge, gradually, in everyday interactions with run-of-the-mill books. 
When truly innovative, world-changing natural knowledge did begin to appear in Elizabethan 
bookshops—in books that revealed the remarkable diversity of plant species across the globe, 
in diagrams that offered a glimpse of the interior of the human body, or in simple illustrations 
that altered the shape of the universe—English readers were primed to train their analytical acumen on 
those practical books, too. In the everyday practices of reading, editing, amending, and even censoring 
practical books, ordinary English people grew into capable and confident judges of natural knowledge.
