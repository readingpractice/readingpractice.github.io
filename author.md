**Dr. Melissa Reynolds** is a cultural historian of medieval and early modern Europe with broad 
research interests in the
history of medicine and science, the history of gender and the body, and the history of
material texts. In her research and teaching, she is particularly interested in
tracing how elite or learned cultures of medical and scientific knowledge are conveyed
to ‘ordinary’ people through non-elite media, and in turn, how access to this knowledge
brought about cultural change. In August 2024, she will join the faculty of TCU as an Assistant Professor of Early Modern European History. She was previously Perkins-Cotsen Postdoctoral Fellow in the Society of Fellows and a Lecturer in History at Princeton University, as well as a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wolf Humanities Center and Lecturer in History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylsvania. Her work has been recognized with fellowships and awards from the American Association for the History of Medicine, the Renaissance Society of America, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Medieval Academy of America, and the Rare Books School at the University of Virginia.
