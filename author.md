**Dr. Melissa Reynolds** is a cultural historian of medieval and early modern Europe with broad 
research interests in the
history of medicine and science, the history of gender and the body, and the history of
material texts. In her research and teaching, she is particularly interested in
tracing how elite or learned cultures of medical and scientific knowledge are conveyed
to ‘ordinary’ people through non-elite media, and in turn, how access to this knowledge
brought about cultural change. For the 2023-24 academic year, she is a Mellon Postdoctoral 
Fellow at the Wolf Humanities Center and a Lecturer in the History and Sociology of Science
department at the University of Pennsylvania. Previously she was
the David Bartholomae Postdoctoral Fellow at Rutgers University, and from 2019-2022, she was 
the Perkins-Cotsen Postdoctoral Fellow in the Society of Fellows in
the Liberal Arts and a Lecturer in History at Princeton University. She received her Ph.D.
in History from Rutgers University, and a BA and MA from the University of Alabama.
