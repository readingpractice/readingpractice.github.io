### Editions of Practical Books Published from 1485 to 1600

In _Reading Practice_ I trace the circulation of natural knowledge in both fifteenth-century
manuscripts and early printed books. The data for these print appendices was scraped from the 
_English Short Title Catalogue,_ accessed at [http://estc.bl.uk](http://estc.bl.uk), which I 
searched to find all editions of medical recipes, herbals, astrological treatises, agricultural 
treatises, anatomies, surgeries, health regimens, urinaries, books on distillation, agricultural 
manuals, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine published between 1485 and 1600. I used 
Zotero's web-scraping tool to pull publication data from the online _ESTC_, and then exported 
my Zotero data into a CSV file so that I could clean and standardize the data using OpenRefine.

The spreadsheet below contains information on the publication date, printer,
size, and genre of natural knowledge for every edition printed between 1485 and 1600
that I identified in the _English Short Title Catalogue._
