### Format and Contents of Vernacular Practical Manuscripts

The data in the spreadsheet below was collected over ten years of research trips to reading rooms and 
archives to view fifteenth-century manuscripts. My focus on these trips was to identify 
fifteenth-century English manuscripts wholly comprised of medical and scientific information and 
mostly written in the vernacular. I identified potential candidates by searching special collections
catalogues and referencing the Voigts-Kurtz database of [Medical and Scientific Writings in Middle English](https://cctr1.umkc.edu/search)
and then examined the manuscripts in person or online. Manuscripts that contained more than an occasional
recipe or two in Latin were eliminated, as were manuscripts that were comprised of literary or
religious material. My aim was to discover whether non-elite fifteenth-century English people conceived
of books as tools for everyday practices like tending wounds, forecasting the weather, or making medicines.
I focused on manuscripts solely composed in the vernacular because I believed these Manuscripts
would get me closer to understanding how newly literate people with little experience with books
incorporated the written word into their day to day lives.

The product of this research is the spreadsheet below, containing information on the approximate age,
composition, size, format, and contents of these manuscripts, as well as notations about whether the 
manuscripts contain reader marks from the fifteenth, sixteenth, or seventeenth centuries. Transcriptions 
of these reader marks are available in [Manuscripts Appendix B]({{ site.baseurl }}/manuscripts-appendix-b), 
while descriptions of readers' censorship of recipes is available in [Manuscripts Appendix C]({{ site.baseurl }}/manuscripts-appendix-c).
