#### Reader Marks and Scribal Notes in Practical Manuscripts

The spreadsheet below contains transcriptions of every reader mark in a fifteenth-
century practical manuscript that I could attribute to a reader or which could be dated 
definitively. In addition, the spreadsheet contains notes about other reader and scribal additions,
like added recipes or indices. I note the location of these marks and indicate
whether they were made in the fifteenth (XV), sixteenth (XVI), or seventeenth (XVII)
centuries. In total, the spreadsheet contains notes or transcriptions of over 500 separate
instances of reader interactions with practical manuscripts which formed
the basis for the narrative history I tell in _Reading Practice._
