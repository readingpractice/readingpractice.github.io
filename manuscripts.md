The research for _Reading Practice_ entailed ten years of trips to archives and libraries in
the United States and the United Kingdom. I visited the British, Bodleian, Cambridge University,
Folger, Wellcome, and Huntington Libraries to view manuscripts filled with vernacular
medicine and science. This research would not have been been possible without
the incredible research of Linda Ehrsam Voigts and Patricia Deery Kurtz, whose electronic
database of [_Scientific and Medical Writings in Old and Middle English_](https://cctr1.umkc.edu/search)
made scholars aware of the vast archive of vernacular natural knowledge owned and read by
English people prior to the coming of the printing press. Using the Voigts-Kurtz database
and published library catalogues, I identified over 320 manuscripts that I thought might meet
my definition of a "practical book." I began simply by weeding out manuscripts with a great deal
of Latin because my intent was to better understand the interests and abilities of non-elite,
lay readers in fifteenth-century England.
