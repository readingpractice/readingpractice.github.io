#### Identifying Practical Manuscripts

Research for _Reading Practice_ began with a simple question: how did fifteenth-century English people 
feel about their relationship to their bodies and to the natural world once they could access 
knowledge about both in the pages of books? It wasn't until the late fourteenth-century that such
knowledge became available to non-elite English people in vernacular translation, and over the course
of the fifteenth-century, hundreds (if not thousands) of English people commissioned or created
manuscripts to collect it. I began searching for these manuscripts in the summer of 2014, using the Voigts-Kurtz 
database of [Medical and Scientific Writings in Middle English](https://cctr1.umkc.edu/search), compiled over several decades
by Linda Ehrsam Voigts and Patricia Deery Kurtz, and now containing data on more than 1200 Middle
English manuscripts containing vernacular medical or scientific texts. 
<br>
<br>
In addition to locating promising manuscripts on the Voigts-Kurtz database, I also combed the manuscript
catalogues for holdings at the Beinecke Library, Yale University; Bodleain Library, University of Oxford;
British Library, London; Cambridge University Library, Cambridge; Henry E. Huntington Library, San Marino, CA;
Morgan Library, New York; National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD; Trinity College Cambridge Library, Cambridge;
University of Glasgow Library, Glasgow; and Wellcome Library, London.
<br>
<br>
After identifying promising manuscripts, I made multiple research trips to these libraries, many of which had thankfully
changed their photography policies shortly before this project began. From an initial corpus of over 300 potential "practical manuscripts"
I weeded out exemplars that contained numerous Latin texts, as well as manuscripts that contained texts
unrelated to medicine and science. My aim was to discover whether non-elite fifteenth-century English people conceived
of books as tools for everyday practices like tending wounds, forecasting the weather, or making medicines.
I hoped to understand how newly literate people with little experience with books sought knowledge in books that
were unlike the books they had been trained to revere in mass or at prayer. I was left with a handlist of 182 vernacular "practical" manuscripts,
all but a handful of which I have consulted in person.
<br>

#### About the Data

The spreadsheet below contains the following information on each of these 182 vernacular manuscripts:
- Shelfmark
- Archive/library
- Approximate date of creation
- Writing support (paper or parchment)
- Number of folios
- Size in mm
- Quality of scribal hand
- Information on contents
- Information on reader marks
- Information on reader cancellations or censorship
- URL for digital facsimile, if available


Over the course of nearly ten years in reading rooms looking at these practical manuscripts,
it became apparent that the same categories of natural knowledge reappear over and over again
within these collections, even if individual texts themselves vary from exemplar to exemplar. Users who
wish to trace the circulation of individual Middle English texts would be better served consulting
the [Voigts-Kurtz database](https://cctr1.umkc.edu/search), the [Digital Index of Middle English Verse](https://www.dimev.net),
or George Keiser's _A Manual of the Writings in Middle English, 1050â€“1500_, Vol. 10: Science and Information (New Haven, 1998).
However, because I remain interested in readers' experience of natural knowledge, the spreadsheet below does
note which genres of natural knowledge appear in each practical manuscript. My aim in noting the 
contents of these manuscripts is to indicate which genres of natural knowledge were most compelling
to English readers; which were most popular; and which most often appeared side-by-side within the same collections.
My purpose was to understand each of these collections as a whole, reconstructing patterns
of use over time. 
<br>
<br>
As such, the spreadsheet below indicates whether each of the 182 manuscripts in my corpus contains:
- Illustrations
- Medical recipes
- An herbal
- Charms
- A medical treatise
- A treatise on phlebotomy
- Reproductive recipes
- Uroscopy
- A surgical text or surgical recipes
- Craft recipes
- A dietary or health regimen
- Plague treatise
- Prognostication
- Text on weights and measures
- Text on animal husbandry
- Text on planting, grafting, or gardening
- Text on hawking, hunting, or fishing
- An almanac
- A treatise on astrology
- Culinary recipes

For each of these categories, where possible, I also indicate which herbal, recipe collection, 
uroscopy text, etc. each of these manuscripts contains.

#### About the Manuscript Appendices

As part of my quest to understand how fifteenth- and later sixteenth- and seventeenth-century
readers engaged with these manuscript collections of natural knowledge, I paid special attention
to evidence of reader interactions in marginal annotations, added recipes, and cancellations. 
The two manuscript appendices contain transcriptions of these reader interactions. [Manuscript
Appendix A]({{ site.baseurl }}/manuscript-appendix-a) contains transcriptions of reader marks that
can be dated or attributed to a reader, notes about other additions to manuscripts like added
recipes or corrections, and the approximate date of each mark. 
[Manuscript Appendix B]({{ site.baseurl }}/manuscripts-appendix-b) contains descriptions of 
reader cancellations and censorship in practical manuscripts. Both kinds of reader marks tell
a story about the ways English readers interacted with books of natural knowledge, and in
turn, how that natural knowledge shaped their relationship to their bodies and the wider world.
