The following digital appendices present data gathered through examination of 182 fifteenth-century
vernacular English manuscripts containing texts related to medicine and practical science. I identified
these manuscripts using the Voigts-Kurtz database of [Medical and Scientific Writings in Middle English](https://cctr1.umkc.edu/search),
and by consulting the catalogues of the Beinecke Library, Yale University; Bodleain Library, University of Oxford;
British Library, London; Cambridge University Library, Cambridge; Henry E. Huntington Library, San Marino, CA;
Morgan Library, New York; National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD; Trinity College Cambridge Library, Cambridge;
University of Glasgow Library, Glasgow; and Wellcome Library, London.

I consulted the majority of the manuscripts listed in the following three digital appendices in person in manuscript
reading rooms in the United Kingdom and United States, but those at the Bibliothèque interuniversité de santé, 
the University of Glasgow, and the Beinecke Library I viewed in digital facsimile. I have included URLS for manuscripts that 
are available in digital facsimile in [Manuscript Appendix A]({{ site.baseurl }}/manuscript-appendix-a).
