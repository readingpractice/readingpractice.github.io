[Manuscript Appendix A](/manuscript-appendix-a) describes the 182 "practical manuscripts" analyzed
in _Reading Practice_, with information on the parameters used to identify those specific manuscripts. 
View a spreadsheet containing information on the format and contents of each manuscript, or download
that data in CSV form.

[Manuscript Appendix B](/manuscript-appendix-b) contains transcriptions of all
reader marks in my corpus of 182 practical manuscripts that can be dated or attributed to a reader, 
as well as notes about other additions to manuscripts, like added
recipes or corrections, and the approximate date of each mark.  

<br>
[Manuscript Appendix C](/manuscripts-appendix-c) contains descriptions of 
reader cancellations and censorship in practical manuscripts. Both kinds of reader marks tell
a story about the ways English readers interacted with books of natural knowledge, and in
turn, how that natural knowledge shaped their relationship to their bodies and the wider world.
