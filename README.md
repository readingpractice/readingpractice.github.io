This repository includes files for developing a static site to host bibliographical data collected over ten years of research for the academic monograph [_Reading Practice: The Pursuit of Natural Knowledge from Manuscript to Print_](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo222256991.html), forthcoming from The University of Chicago Press in August 2024. 

When finished, readers of the book should be able to access data on the 182 fifteenth-century English medical and scientific manuscripts and over 475 editions of early printed practical books examined for the book.
