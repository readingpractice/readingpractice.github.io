This repository includes files for developing a static site to host bibliographical data collected over ten years of research for the academic monograph _Reading Practice: The Pursuit of Natural Knowledge from Manuscript to Print_, forthcoming from The University of Chicago Press in Spring 2024. 

When finished, readers of the book should be able to access data on the nearly 200 fifteenth-century English medical and scientific manuscripts examined for the book.
