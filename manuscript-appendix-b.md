#### Censorship and Cancellations in Practical Manuscripts

Though fifteenth-century readers did not often cancel or erase the contents of practical manuscripts,
by the later sixteenth century readers had grown concerned about certain genres of texts
in practical manuscripts. For the most part, these concerns were driven by the English Reformation,
which was especially hostile toward the "superstition" and magic associated with the older
medieval church, as well as by rising fears about witchcraft and magic. Indeed, as the spreadsheet
below indicates, the categories of text most often censored by early modern readers often
had to do with charms, incantations, or "natural" magic or with reproductive healthcare, and specifically,
abortion. These categories of knowledge had long been associated with women--even in the fifteenth
century--but it wasn't until the later sixteenth century that we find evidence of readers
censoring such knowledge in the pages of practical manuscripts.
